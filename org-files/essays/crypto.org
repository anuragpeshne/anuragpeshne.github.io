* Cryptography techniques
** ssh
   Using key to login to remote servers. Create public private key pair. Upload
   the public key to remote machine in ~\~/.ssh/authorized_keys~. Login using the
   private key. We can use passphrase as an additional safety measure.

1. Create key pair using ~ssh-keygen~
   - We can encrypt the private key and use a passphrase to decrypt it.
   - This will create ~\~/.ssh/id_rsa~ (private key) and ~\~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~ (public
     key)
2. Upload ~\~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~ to remote server at ~\~/.ssh/authorized_keys~
   or deploy using ~ssh-copy-id username@remote_host~
3. Disable password based ssh login:
   - ~sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config~
   - ~PasswordAuthentication no~
   - ~sudo service ssh restart~
