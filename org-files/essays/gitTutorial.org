* Preface
  This essay is based upon a presentation I gave to the new recruits at my
  (former?) employer [[https://coupondunia.in][CouponDunia]]. While preparing the presentation I went through
  some of the finest Git tutorials[fn:1] which gave me good insight on Git
  internals. Though the knowledge of internal working of Git isn't essential for
  working with it, knowing the stuff under the hood can help to grok Git and help
  solve some of the common problems.

  Since this presentation was made for folks without any prior professional
  experience, it starts with the very basics of version control system. If you find
  it trivial, feel free to jump to the topic [[#advanced-commands][advanced commands]].
