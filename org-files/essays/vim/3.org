This is part 3 of a series of tutorial to Vim. You can read [[./2.org][Part 2 here]].

* Go Mouseless!
  Vim has hundreds of ways to navigate[fn:1]. You can move character by character, word
  by word, line, function, page among several other ways. You will soon release
  that you not only do not need mouse, in fact using mouse is expensive. It takes
  too much time to reach mouse, too much time to reach the precise location. Really,
  using mouse while programming is an anti-pattern.

  But not all editors are so keyboard friendly, there are shortcuts for common commands
  but for rest you need to use mouse to go deep into menu to find the button. You
  can use keyboard to do the same (using ~<alt>+f~) but it is not a good experience.
  Vim treat keyboard as first class citizen. Every command is accessible via keyboard
  in an efficient way. Just press ~:~ and press tab for autocomplete.

  While Vim supports mouse too[fn:2], I would highly encourage you to not enable
  those options and give mouseless operation a whole hearted try.

* Be Lazy
** Home Row
  Vim takes saving efforts to the extreme. It supports and encourages use of h, j,
  k, l to be used as arrow keys so that user do not have to leave home row.
  | h | Left  |
  | j | Down  |
  | k | Up    |
  | l | Right |

** Words
   There is a better way to traverse a sentence than to go a character per stroke
   and that's word by word. Press ~w~ to jump to start of next *word*, ~e~ to go to
   *end* of word. If you want to jump complex word (word joined by a hyphen, like
   a super-word), use ~W~ and corresponding ~E~.

   Going *back* is same using ~b~ and ~B~.

*** Composing
    Still, traversing a 20 word long sentence using ~w~ takes effort. Wouldn't
    it be better if we could directly jump to, say, 5th word. And that's where
    command composing comes into play. Simple press ~5w~ and you will jump 5 words.
    Of course, this is generic, you can put in any number followed by, as we'll see
    later, any command to execute that command that many times.
    So, ~100b~ takes use back 100 words.

*** Some more line navigation
    - ~$~: jump to end of line
    - ~0~: jump to beginning of line (column 0)
    - ~^~: jump to beginning of line skipping the whitespace
      - this one is especially useful while working with indented code.
        #+BEGIN_SRC javascript -n
        var foo = function (arg) {
            var fooClose = function (argClose) {
                if (argClose == 2) {
                    argClose += 2;
                }
            }
        }
        #+END_SRC
        Here pressing ~^~ anywhere on line 3 will take us to ~if~ rather than column 0.
**** Find
     Even more power command if ~f~. Hit ~f~ followed by character to directly jump
     to word starting with that character. Try this in Vim:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     humpty dumpty sat on a wall
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     Now while the cursor is on column 0[fn:3], hit ~fs~, your cursor should directly jump
     to "sat". What if there were multiple words with same start character:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     humpty dumpty sat on a west wall
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     No problem, you can compose find command: hit ~2fw~ to *find 2nd* /w/
     Also, to /find/ a character backwards, use ~F~. As, we'll see in future parts,
     this is a common style in Vim: to do something in reverse, use ~<shift>~ and
     the key.

** Jumpnig through the complete buffer
   - ~<ctrl>+u~: scroll *up*
   - ~<ctrl>+d~: scroll *down*
   - ~:<number>~: to jump to that line number
     - very handy while debugging or when compiler complaints about line number
       in source code, just hit ~:31~ to jump to line 31.
   - ~gg~: go to beginning to buffer
   - ~G~: go to end of buffer
   - ~gf~: go to file at path under cursor
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     /etc/hosts
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     Just type those lines in Vim buffer, write file, and press ~gf~ while cursor
     is anywhere on path and see the magic.
     - this is very handy while writing configuration scripts, or bash scripts.
   - ~gd~: go to definition
     - poor man's jump to definition: use this to jump to first occurrence of a word.

  These are by no way comprehensive list of jumping commands. But a good point to
  start. You can find more ways of jumping easily online or, again, as we shall in
  future, in Vim help menu.

[fn:1] I wouldn't be surprised if this is not actually an exaggeration
[fn:2] [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225057/use-mouse-scroll-wheel-in-vim][Use mouse scroll wheel in Vim]]
[fn:3] ~f~ starts /finding/ from that location, so starting from column 0 gives us freedom of jumping to any word.
