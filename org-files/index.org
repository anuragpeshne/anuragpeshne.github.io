* Hello
  My name is Anurag Peshne. I'm interested in Programing Languages, Operating
  Systems and Text Editors (particularly Vim and Emacs), Lisp and Functional
  Programing.

  I studied Computer Science at [[http://vnit.ac.in/][VNIT]] and have experience working with server teams
  at multinational corporation as well as a startup.

  Besides CS, I'm interested in cycling and [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/anuragpeshne/][photography]]. Moon and time lapsed
  photography are my favourites.
